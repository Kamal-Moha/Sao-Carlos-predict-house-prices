## Project background

The real estate market has a great impact in people’s lives and in the economy of cities like São Carlos which concentrates a great variety of infrastructure and populations of all incomes. The city’s strategic location, booming industries, and renowned educational institutions have attracted a surge of potential homebuyers and investors. However, with the increasing complexity and variability of house prices in São Carlos, renting or buying a house has become a difficult task that usually involves a lot of fraud, negotiating deals, researching the local areas and so on. Therefore, there is a growing need for accurate and reliable machine learning models to predict property values, aiding buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## The problem

A Machine Learning based solution can be useful to accurately forecast housing prices in different neighborhoods of São Carlos. By leveraging historical data, socioeconomic factors, and advanced algorithms, this project aims to provide a tool for people to navigate the complex real estate market in São Carlos. The accurate prediction of house prices in São Carlos is crucial for various stakeholders, including homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors. Reliable price predictions can help buyers make informed decisions about their investments, assist sellers in setting competitive prices, and enable real estate professionals to provide better guidance to their clients.

## Project goals

The specific goals and deliverables are:

* Create a comprehensive dataset by collecting and preprocessing real estate data from reliable sources, ensuring data quality and integrity.
* Develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting house prices based on a variety of relevant features such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and historical sales data.
* Evaluate and optimize the model's performance by employing various techniques such as feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
* Build an interactive web application that allows users to input the details of a house and obtain an estimated price prediction from the trained machine learning model.
* Generate detailed documentation that outlines the project methodology, data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and any additional insights or findings discovered during the project, providing a clear roadmap for reproducibility and future enhancements.
